# sql_generator

## What might this be?
This is something I wrote a long time ago so that I could get SQL statements faster and spend more time on the actual schema while working.

## TL;DR
The instructions are self-explanatory. Just download and run. I haven't tried it on different Python version but anything above 2.7 that uses ```print()``` should be fine.

## Future Plans
There should be other scripts that do a better job than this one. I just wrote this as a quick shortcut in the initial days so I do not intend to improve it at all.
